# Constructor-Word-Guess
This project terminal-based word guess game using Node.js constructors.  The game is started by entering "node index" into the terminal command line, then follow the prompts to guess letters in determining the word.  This particular game consists of randomly selected names of my favorite authors :)  The player will have 10 chances to guess the word correctly, otherwise game over.
